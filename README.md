Join me as I begin my transformation from USCG Rescue Pilot to Cyber Security Professional here. I imagine that this will grow as I learn and branch out. 

I have applied for and been accepted to the Cybersecurity Workforce Certification Training (CWCT) program through Purdue University Northwest in collaboration with Ivy Tech Community College, University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC), and University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC).

Created repository for CWCT Python Essentials class scripts.
